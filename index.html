				<h3>Personality</h3>
				<p>My Myers-Briggs personality type is ENTP. In simple language, that's sociable, technically minded, and competitive. If not, I suppose the assessment wasn't all too accurate.</p>

				<h3>Academics</h3>

				<p>I have been a strong student my entire life, partiularly in math and the sciences. </p>

				<h3>Lifetime Athletic Interests</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Karate</li>
					<li>Soccer</li>
					<li>Distance Running</li>
					<li>Table Tennis</li>
					<li>Weight Lifting</li>
					<li>Climbing</li>
				</ul>
				I have also spent significant time with ultimate, cycling, and basketball, but never the same singular focus of the others listed above.
