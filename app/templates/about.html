  <h4>So how did this website come to be?</h4>
  <p>Should you know me, the question is perhaps more appropriately formulated, “Why did this website come to be <i>so late</i>?” I do not wish to mince words in my answer by succumbing to a socially encouraged facade of humility: I am exceptionally intelligent. Particularly in technical pursuits, think math and physics, everything always just came naturally. Moreover, I learn ardently. Had computer science been part of my education, it is obvious I would have excelled there too. The problem is that despite going to a highly touted public school, there was not a shred of CS in the entire curriculum. I was fully engaged with being the best student, but that also meant an imperfect education, namely the cookie-cutter one prescribed to me.</p>
  <p>Fast forward to May 2016 and I’ve earned a Bachelor’s in abstract mathematics. Despite this, I have a serious lack of career guidance. I am loosely pursuing professorship, but this notion is a relic from childhood that I have yet to revisit with adult scrutiny.</p>
